Binary Formats
==============

The general principle is fixed-size fields followed by variable fields (or
field, in this case, generally just the path).

There is versioning in the formats; coal will hopefully remain backwards
compatible.

Offsets are to nearest byte, sizes are in bytes or :bits

All paths are written with a \0 on the end, for ease of copying to buffers.
String length is quoted length - 1


Binary Data Format
==================

Input:

Offset   Size     Field
0        1        Version
1        1        Type (1 = data, 8 = query, 9 = query answer, 16 = tree query, 17 = tree answer)
2        2        Record size (ie, size - 4 more bytes to read)
4        4        (time_t) timestamp
8        4        (float) value
12		 var      Path (length = record size - 12, capped at 1024)

Output:

None


Binary Query Format
===================

Input:

Offset   Size     Field
0        1        Version
1        1        Type (1 = data, 8 = query, 9 = query answer, 16 = tree query, 17 = tree answer)
2        2        Record size (ie, size - 4 more bytes to read)
4        4        Start time (ignored in tree queries)
8        4        End time (ignored in tree queries)
12       1        Metric (ignored in tree queries)
13       var      Path (length = record size - 13, capped at 1024)


Output (tree query):

Offset   Size     Field
0        1        Version
1        1        Type (1 = data, 8 = query, 9 = query answer, 16 = tree query, 17 = tree answer)
2        2        Padding (record size not confined to 64k)
4        4        Record size
8        1        Requested node type (1 = leaf, 2 = branch)
9        1        Padding
10        2        Result count (which we'll call N)
<N times, starting offset X = 12>
X+4i     1        Node type (1 = leaf, 2 = branch)
X+1+4i   1        Padding
X+2+4i   2        Path length (capped at 1024)
...
<i = 0 to N-1 times, starting offset X = 12 + 4i, len being sum of path lengths to i>
X+(len)  var      Path
...

For example (numeric values are hex, leading zeros of single bytes are
left off, ASCII characters are shown)

    00 . . . . . . .08 . . . . . . .10 . . . . . . .18 . . . . . . .20
01   1 3 027 2 0 003 2 0 003 2 0 006 1 0 008 f o o\0 s u b d i r\0 d a
02   t a p a t h\0


Output (data query):

Offset   Size     Field
0        1        Version
1        1        Type (1 = data, 8 = query, 9 = query answer, 16 = tree query, 17 = tree answer)
2        2        Padding (record size not confined to 64k)
4        4        Record size
8        4        Start time of data (might not match query)
12       4        End time of data (might not match query)
16       1        Metric
17       1        Padding
18       2        Path length
20       4        Result count (which we'll call N)
<i = 0 to N-1 times, starting offset X = 24)
X+12i    4        (time_t) timestamp
X+4+12i  4        Flags ( 0x1 : valid )
X+8+12i  4        (float) value
...
24+12i    var      Path
