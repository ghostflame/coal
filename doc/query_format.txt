Query Format
============

Queries can have up to 5 fields

Order  Field       Type        Default
1      Path        String      None - required
2      Start       Timestamp   None - presence denotes a data query, absence a tree query
3      End         Timestamp   Current time
4      Metric      String      mean - taken from [ mean, min, max, count, sum, spread ]
5      Format      String      fields - taken from [ fields, json ]



In line format, these are presented separated by a space ' ' and terminated
by a newline '\n'.  The field count is noted and decisions made on the query
based on it.

Tree queries - to explore the tree - expect only a single field, the path.
This will result in a list of the child node names, and whether they are leaves
or branches.

Further fields result in a data query, which returns nothing for a branch.


Return Formats
==============


Line format:

The return of a data query is:

<path> <from> <to> <metric> <period> <result count>\n
[<timestamp>,<value>|"null"]\n
[<timestamp>,<value>|"null"]\n
...

Until all results are sent.

The return of a tree query is:

<path> 0 0 "tree" 0 <result count>\n
"leaf"|"branch",<path>\n
"leaf"|"branch",<path>\n
...

Until all results are sent.


Json format:

The return of a data query is:
{
	"path":     <path>,
	"start":    <start>,
	"end":      <end>,
	"metric":   <metric>,
	"period":   <period>,
	"count":    <result count>,
    "values":	[
		[<timestamp>,<value>|"null"],
		[<timestamp>,<value>|"null"],
		...
	]
}


There return of a tree query is:

{
	"path":     <path>,
	"count":    <result count>,
	"nodes":    [
		["leaf"|"branch",<name>],
		["leaf"|"branch",<name>],
		...
	]
}
