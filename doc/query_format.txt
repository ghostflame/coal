Query Format
============

Order Field     Type       Default
1     Type      String     data, taken from [ data, search, tree ]
2     Format    String     fields - taken from [ fields, json ]
3     Path      String     None - required
4     Start     Timestamp  Now-24hrs.  Only valid in a 'data'
5     End       Timestamp  Current Time.  Only valid in a 'data' type
6     Metric    String     mean - taken from [ mean, min, max, count, sum, spread ]


In line format, these are presented separated by a space ' ' and terminated
by a newline '\n'.  The field count is noted and decisions made on the query
based on it.

Tree queries - to explore the tree - expect only a single field, the path.
This will result in a list of the child node names, and whether they are leaves
or branches.

Further fields result in a data query, which returns nothing for a branch.


Return Formats
==============


Line format:


The return of a data query is:

<path> <from> <to> <metric> <period> <type> <result count>\n
[<timestamp>,<value>|"null"]\n
[<timestamp>,<value>|"null"]\n
...

Until all results are sent.

The return of a search query is:
<string> 0 0 "search" 0 1 <result count>\n
<path>\n
<path>\n
...
Until all results are sent.

The return of a tree query is:

<path> 0 0 "tree" 0 <type> <result count>\n
"leaf"|"branch",<path>\n
"leaf"|"branch",<path>\n
...

Until all results are sent.

In both the above, type is 0 (branch) or 1 (leaf), referring to the requested
node.



Json format:

The return of a data query is:
{
	"path":     <path>,
	"start":    <start>,
	"end":      <end>,
	"metric":   <metric>,
	"period":   <period>,
	"count":    <result count>,
    "values":	[
		[<timestamp>,<value>|"null"],
		[<timestamp>,<value>|"null"],
		...
	]
}


The return of a search query is:
{
    "regex":    <string>,
    "type":     "leaf",
    "count":    <result count>,
    "paths":    p
        <path>,
        <path>,
    ]
}


There return of a tree query is:

{
	"path":     <path>,
	"type":		["leaf"|"branch"],
	"count":    <result count>,
	"nodes":    [
		["leaf"|"branch",<name>],
		["leaf"|"branch",<name>],
		...
	]
}
