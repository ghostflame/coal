Query Format
============

Order Field     Type       Default
1     Type      String     data, taken from [ data, search, tree ]
2     ID        Integer    Query ID - optional, autogen'd if absent
3     Format    String     fields - taken from [ fields, json ]
4     Path      String     None - required
5     Start     Timestamp  Now-24hrs.  Only valid in a 'data'
6     End       Timestamp  Current Time.  Only valid in a 'data' type
7     Metric    String     mean - taken from [ mean, min, max, count, sum, spread ]


In line format, these are presented separated by a space ' ' and terminated
by a newline '\n'.  The field count is noted and decisions made on the query
based on it.

Tree queries - to explore the tree - expect only a single field, the path.
This will result in a list of the child node names, and whether they are leaves
or branches.

Further fields result in a data query, which returns nothing for a branch.


Return Formats
==============


Line format:


The return of a data query is:
data <id> <from> <to> <period> <metric> 1 <result count> <path>\n
[<timestamp>,<value>|"null"]\n
[<timestamp>,<value>|"null"]\n
...

Until all results are sent.


The return of a search query is:
search <id> 0 0 0 none 0 <result count> <search string>\n
<path>\n
<path>\n
...
Until all results are sent.


The return of a tree query is:
tree <id> 0 0 0 none <node type> <result count> <path>\n
"leaf"|"branch",<path>\n
"leaf"|"branch",<path>\n
...

Until all results are sent.

In both the above, type is 0 (branch) or 1 (leaf), referring to the requested
node.



Json format:

All of the returned formats have some fields in common
{
    "header":
    {
        "type":     <query type>,
        "id":       <query id>,
        "count":    <result count>,
    },
}

Invalid queries return as:
{
    "header":
    {
        "type":     <query type>,
        "id":       <query id>,
        "count":    0,
    },
    "error":        <query error message>
}


Data queries return as:
{
    "header":
    {
        "type":     "data",
        "id":       <query id>,
        "start":    <query start ts>,
        "end":      <query end ts>,
        "period":   <query data period sec>,
        "metric":   <query metric name>,
        "path":     <query path>,
        "count":    <result count>,
    },
    "values":
    [
        [<timestamp>,<value>|"null"],
        [<timestamp>,<value>|"null"],
        ...
    ]
}


Search queries return as:
{
    "header":
    {
        "type":     "data",
        "id":       <query id>,
        "search":   <query search string>,
        "count":    <result count>,
    },
    "paths":
    [
        <path>,
        <path>,
        ...
    ]
}

Tree queries return as:
{
    "header":
    {
        "type":     "tree",
        "id":       <query id>,
        "leaf:      <queried node is leaf? 0|1>,
        "path":     <query path>,
        "count":    <result count>,
    },
    "nodes":
    [
        [<node is leaf? 0|1>,<node name>],
        [<node is leaf? 0|1>,<node name>],
        ...
    ]
}
